<div class="col-2"><img src="CRUD.jpg"></img></div>
This is a Rest API application using CRUD methodology (create,read,update,delete)
The main propose of this app is to simply create, read, update and delete Pokemons using endpoints.
<br>
I have used Adonis JS for structure of this project (Which is something like Laravel to PHP).
<br>
<br>
Database Installation:
npm i @adonisjs/lucid <br> node ace configure @adonisjs/lucid ->to configure (I choose MYSQL)

to test the api, I have used postman locally and afterward using AdonisJS defined tests and ran:

defining a simple test:
node ace make:test functional pokemon/list  --> Read list of Pok√©mon


run the tests I have wrote:
node ace test --watch
